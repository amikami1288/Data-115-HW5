2)
  Mean: The sum of a group of values, divided by the number of values
  Median:  The middle number in a sequence of numbers
  IQR:  InterQuartile Range is the range between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile
  Variance:  Is a measure of how widely disperced values are, or how un-concentrated
  Skewness:  Skewness (ie. left or right) tells whether the values in a set tend to concentrate more to the left side of the plot or the right side.

  In this dataset, rows (21,36,62, and 105) are outliers.  I used the method of 1.5xIQR beyond the 25th and 75th percentile to determine this.  Row 2 and 15 also fell in this range, however Geneva's and Sydney's ratio of Avg Rent to Avg Disposable Income was close to the average for the whole data set, so I didn't count them as outliers.  Depending on the purpose for the analysis, I would leave the outliers in the plot, I think it is informative to show that there are some examples of cities far more expensive than the average.

  (a)  When looking at the boxplot for Height, it is pretty clear that the data is not very semetrical, as well as being negatively skewed.  
          The boxplot for Weight appears to be more symmetric than the height plot, but still has an negative skew
  (b)  Height histogram makes the skew more more obvious, while the weight histogram still shows the skew, but also makes it appear slightly more symmetrical than before
  (c)  There is a larger spread of male (1) weights.  Male (1)'s also have a higher average weight and upper percentile.
  (e)  The concentration of male (1)'s bmis is lower than that of Male(0)s.  Male(1) also have a more of a right-skew, while the Male(0) is more symmetrical.
  (f)The male(1) have larger value concentrations for height and weight than male(0).  Both male(1) and male(0) have a similar shape to their concentrations.
